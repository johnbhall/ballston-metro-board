## Ballston Metro Board

This script is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi. It will hit the API of WMATA (Washington, DC's Metro) to access real-time train arrival data for Ballston station. Trains will be sorted into two groups: those going toward my office (Westbound Orange) and those going downtown (Eastbound Orange or Silver). The train times will be displayed on 7-segment LEDs connected to the Pi.
